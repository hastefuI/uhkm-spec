# Contributing to UHKM Specification

This project defines and iterates on the UHKM specification.

To keep the spec clear and stable, please follow these short guidelines:

- Open an issue first before opening a PR that introduces new behavior or new pragmas.
- Keep PRs narrowly focused: spec wording, examples, or supporting docs only—no firmware or tooling changes here.
- Use concise, normative language (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) and keep examples minimal but runnable in UHK Smart Macros.
- Update the changelog section in `README.md` when the spec meaningfully changes; include version/tag intent if relevant.
- Follow Conventional Commits with a scope, e.g., `feat(spec): ...`, `chore(docs): ...`, `fix(example): ...`.
- Include a quick rationale in the PR description: what changed, why, and any downstream impact.
- Chore: Minor fixes such as typos and comment improvements. Please group related typo and comment-only changes into a single pull request whenever possible.
- By contributing you agree your changes are licensed under the repository's MIT License.
